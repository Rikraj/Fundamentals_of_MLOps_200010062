AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes. AIOps uses machine learning and analytics to analyze big data obtained via different tools.
MLOps and AIOps are quite different terms.
- AIOps is all about supporting and reacting to its issues in real-time and providing analytics to your operations teams. These functions include performance monitoring, event analysis, correlation, and IT automation.
- Process and manage a large amount of data effectively and efficiently.
- It leverages revolutionary AI technologies to solve IT challenges.
On the other hand,
- MLOps focuse on managing training and testing data that is needed to create machine learning models effectively.
- Streamline collaboration between different teams.
- It is a crucial part of deploying AI and Data Science at scale and in a repeatable manner.

 A model is said to be interpretable if we can interpret directly the impact of its parameters on the outcome.
 For a linear regresssion model-
 -  each coefficient describes the effect on the output of a change of 1 unit of a given input.
 -  The importance of a feature can be seen as the absolute value of the t-statistic value. A feature is important if its coefficient is high and the variance around this estimate is low.
